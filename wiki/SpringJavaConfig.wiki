#summary use java to config vs. xml


== Info ==
 * in order for {{{JavaConfig}}} to work, you must include the CGLIB jar in your list of dependencies.
 * All {{{@Configuration}}} classes are subclassed at startup-time with CGLIB.
 * Restrictions due to the fact that CGLIB dynamically adds features at startup-time:
  * Configuration classes should not be final
  * They should have a constructor with no arguments
