=== Define Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control ===
 * _*Dependency Injection* is a process whereby objects define their dependencies, that is, the other objects they work with, only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse, hence the name *Inversion of Control (IoC)*, of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies by using direct construction of classes, or a mechanism such as the Service Locator pattern._

 * Inversion of Control (IoC) [http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/beans.html HERE]
===  List the advantages of Dependency Injection ===
 * Container manages the lifecycle of the application. (e.g. all beans are fully initialized before they are used)
 * Beans are created in the correct order based on their dependencies.
 * Each bean is bound to a unique id.  The id of the bean, by convention, reflects the service the bean provides to clients.
 * The container ({{{ApplicationContext}}}) encapsulates the bean implementations chosen for a given deployment.  In other words, the container _conceals implementation details_.

 * Be able to write XML code for constructor injection
 * Be able to write XML code for setter injection
 * List the (non-web) scopes for beans
 * Identify the default scope for beans
