#summary Remoting

=== Goals of Spring Remoting ===
 * Hide 'plumbing' code
 * Configure and expose services *declaratively*
 * Support multiple protocols in a consistent way

=== Advantages: Spring Remoting vs. RMI ===
==== Problems with traditional remoting and RMI ====
 * Big Picture: _Remoting mechanisms provide an abstraction over transport details._
 * Abstractions are 'leaky', meaning the code must conform to a particular model.
 * RMI:
  * {{{Service}}} interface extends *{{{Remote}}}*
  * {{{Service}}} client extends *{{{UnicasterRemoteObject}}}*
  * {{{Client}}} must catch *{{{RemoteException}}}s*
  * *Violates a separation of concerns*
  * *Couples business logic to remoting infrastructure*

=== Goal/Cfg of RMI Service Exporter ===

=== Goal/Cfg of RMI Proxy Generator
=== Difference between RMI Service Exporter and {{{HttpInvoker}}} ===
=== {{{HttpInvoker}}} Questions ===
 * Does {{{HttpInvoker}}} require running on a web server on the client side?
 * Does {{{HttpInvoker}}} require running on a web server on the server side?
