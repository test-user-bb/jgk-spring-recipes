#summary Remoting

 * [http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/remoting.html Spring Remoting]

=== Goals of Spring Remoting ===
 * Hide 'plumbing' code
 * Configure and expose services *declaratively*
 * Support multiple protocols in a consistent way

=== Advantages: Spring Remoting vs. RMI ===
==== Problems with traditional remoting and RMI ====
 * Big Picture: _Remoting mechanisms provide an abstraction over transport details._
 * Abstractions are 'leaky', meaning the code must conform to a particular model.
 * RMI:
  * {{{Service}}} interface extends *{{{Remote}}}*
  * {{{Service}}} client extends *{{{UnicasterRemoteObject}}}*
  * {{{Client}}} must catch *{{{RemoteException}}}s*
  * *Violates a separation of concerns*
  * *Couples business logic to remoting infrastructure*
 * RMI model is invasive - server and client code is coupled to the framework
  * RMI: server-side exposes a skeleton
  * RMI: client-side invokes methods on a stub (proxy)
  * RMI: java serialization is used for marshalling
 * Spring's RMI Service Exporter
  * Transparently expose an existing {{{POJO}}} service to the RMI registry
   * no need to write binding code
  * Avoids typical RMI requirements:
   * Service interface does not extend {{{Remote}}}
   * Service class is a {{{POJO}}}

=== Spring Remoting:  Declarative Approach ===
 * Spring's abstraction uses a configuration-based approach
 * Server side:
  * Expose existing services with *NO* code changes!
 * Client side:
  * Invoke remote methods from existing code
  * Take advantage of polymorphism by using dependency injection
=== Spring Remoting: Consistency across protocols ===
 * Spring's exporters and proxy {{{FactoryBean}}}s bring consistent approach to multiple protocols:
  * provides flexibility
  * promotes ease of adoption
 * Server Side
  * expose a single service over multiple protocols
 * Client Side
  * switch easily between protocols (RMI, {{{HttpInvoker}}}, Hessian/Burlap)
   * Hessian - binary web service protocol
   * Burlap - xml web service protocol
  * migrate between remote vs. local deployments

=== Goal/Cfg of RMI Service Exporter ===
 * Spring provides *exporters* to handle server-side requirements:
  * binding to registry or exposing an endpoint
  * conforming to a programming model if needed

==== Configuring RMI Service Exporter ====
 * Star with an existing POJO service:
{{{
  <bean id="myService" class="com.jgk.MyServiceImpl">
    <property name="myRepository" ref="someMyRepository"/>
  </bean>
}}}
 * Define a bean to export it
{{{
  <bean class="org.springframework.remoting.rmi.RmiServiceExporter">
    <property name="serviceName" value="myService"/>  (binds to rmiRegistry as "myService")
    <property name="serviceInterface" value="com.jgk.MyService"/>
    <property name="service" ref="myService"/>
    <property name="registryPort" value="1099"/>  (not required but enables changing RMI registry port)
  </bean>
}}}

=== Goal/Cfg of RMI Proxy Generator ===
 * Spring provides {{{FactoryBean}}}s that generate *proxies* to handle client-side requirements
  * Communicate with server-side endpoint
  * convert remote exceptions to a runtime hierarchy
==== Configuring RMI Proxy ====
 * define a factory bean to generate the proxy
{{{
  <bean id="myService"
        class="org.springframework.remoting.rmi.RmiProxyFactoryBean">
    <property name="serviceInterface" value="com.jgk.MyService"/>
    <property name="serviceUrl" value="rmi://jgk:1099/myService"/>
  </bean>
}}}
 * Inject the factory bean into the client
{{{
  <bean id="myDesktopUI" class="com.jgk.client.MyDesktopUI">
    <property name="myService" ref="myService"/>
  </bean>
}}}

=== Difference between RMI Service Exporter and {{{HttpInvoker}}} ===
=== {{{HttpInvoker}}} ===
 * Spring's HTTP invoker. Spring provides a special remoting strategy which allows for Java serialization via HTTP, supporting any Java interface (just like the RMI invoker). The corresponding support classes are {{{HttpInvokerProxyFactoryBean}}} and {{{HttpInvokerServiceExporter}}}.
=== {{{HttpInvoker}}} Questions ===
 * Does {{{HttpInvoker}}} require running on a web server on the client side?
 * Does {{{HttpInvoker}}} require running on a web server on the server side?
