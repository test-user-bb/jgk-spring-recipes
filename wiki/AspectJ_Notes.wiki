#summary info about AspectJ

= Introduction =
 * a language specification (new elements (pseudo-keywords) like 'aspect' - which is analogous to 'class')
 * an implementation of AOP
 * Syntax choices:
  * traditional
  * {{{@AspectJ}}}
 * Crosscutting constructs:
  * common (join point, pointcut, and aspect)
  * dynamic (advice)
  * static (inter-type declarations and weave-time declarations)
 * Wildcards ({{{*}}})
 * {{{..}}} any method parameters
== Pointcuts ==
 * select execution of any public method in the system:
{{{
execution(public * *.*(..))
}}}
 * same with a name given to the pointcut:
{{{
pointcut publicOperation() : execution(public * *.*(..));
}}}

=== Aspect ===
 * contains the code expressing the weaving rules for both dynamcic and static crosscutting.
 * aspectcs can have :
  * data
  * methods
  * nested classes
=== Advice ===
 * advice is the code executed at a join point selected by a pointcut.
 * advice can execute:
  * before
  * after
  * around
 * body of advice encapsulates the logic to be executed upon reaching a join point.

=== Parts of a join point ===
 * method name
 * the _this_ object
 * method arguments
