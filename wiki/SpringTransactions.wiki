#summary Transaction Mania

Place Spring Transaction stuff here...
 * [http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/transaction.html#transaction-declarative Declarative Transactions]

== Stuff ==
 * Spring Framework {{{@Transactional}}} annotation with the {{{@TransactionAttribute}}} annotation found in the EJB 3.0 specification
 * ORM-based frameworks *require a transaction* in order to trigger the synchronization between the object cache and the database. It is through a transaction commit that the SQL code is generated and the database affected by the desired action (that is, insert, update, delete). Without a transaction there is no trigger for the ORM to generate SQL code and persist the changes.
 * When using the @Transactional annotation in Spring, you must add the following line to your Spring configuration file:
{{{
<tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager="transactionManager"/>
}}}
