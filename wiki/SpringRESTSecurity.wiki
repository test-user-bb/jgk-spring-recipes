== Main Security Processes ==
 * *Authentication* - process of establishing a principal is who they claim to be (a “principal” generally means a user, device or some other system which can perform an action in your application).
 * *Authorization* - deciding whether a principal should be allowed access to a resource.

Spring Security Authentication technologies support:
 * HTTP BASIC authentication headers
 * HTTP Digest authentication headers
 * HTTP X.509 client certificate exchange
 *  LDAP
 * Form-based authentication (for simple user interface needs)
 * OpenID authentication
 * Authentication based on pre-established request headers (such as Computer Associates Siteminder)
 * JA-SIG Central Authentication Service (otherwise known as CAS, which is a popular open source single sign-on system)
 * Transparent authentication context propagation for Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and HttpInvoker (a Spring remoting protocol)
 * Automatic "remember-me" authentication (so you can tick a box to avoid re-authentication for a predetermined period of time)
 * Anonymous authentication (allowing every unauthenticated call to automatically assume a particular security identity)
 * Run-as authentication (which is useful if one call should proceed with a different security identity)
 * Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS)
 * JEE container autentication
 * Kerberos
 * Third Party (Java Open Source Single Sign On (JOSSO),OpenNMS Network Management Platform,
AppFuse,AndroMDA,Mule ESB,Direct Web Request (DWR),Grails,Tapestry,JTrac,Jasypt,Roller,Elastic Path,Atlassian Crowd)
 * Your own authentication systems
