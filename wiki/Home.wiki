#summary Talks about *jgk-spring-recipes*

= Introduction =

This project is about providing some usage patterns for [http://www.springsource.com/ Spring Framework].
I am not employed by SpringSource nor do I speak on its behalf.  I am, however, a big fan of Spring Framework.

All the projects in here are maven-based projects.  Some are console applications.  Some are web applications.  And others are just to demonstrate an interesting portion of Spring.
