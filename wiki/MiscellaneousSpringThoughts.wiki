#summary Loose ideas about Spring.

 * Spring Testability:
  * easier to test pieces of application in isolation
  * decouples objects from environment
  * Junit annotations:  @Test, @Before, @After
 * Spring Data Access
  * manages resources (connections, transactions)
  * provides API helpers (templates)
  * consistent approach to data access
  * Spring supports many data access technologies, including:
   * JDBC
   * Hibernate
   * JPA
   * iBatis
 * DAO = Repository:  represent your persistence source (database, file system, etc.)
 * Dependency Injection (DI)
  * enables different collaborators to be injected for different environments. (test, production, test database, real/production database)
  * enables testing of classes independent of their collaborators.
 * Constructor Injection advantages:
  * mandatory elements
  * immutable
  * natural to Java
 * Setter Injection advantages:
  * avoid long constructor parameter lists
  * can be inherited
  * clearer/easier to understand since the properties have names
  * constructor args do not have names

 * In Spring a rollback of a transaction occurs in response to a RuntimeException, but if a checked exception is thrown then no rollback.  You can configure so a specific checked exception causes a rollback.
