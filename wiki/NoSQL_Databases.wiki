#summary all about NoSQL

 * based on talks by [http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Using-Spring-with-NoSQL-Databases Chris Richardson and Mark Pollack]

== Why NoSQL ==

== Problems with RDBMS ==
 * ORM impedance mismatch
  * complicated to map domain model to relational schema
  * relational schema is rigid (non-flexible, not easily changed)
 * RDBMS difficult to scale writes to DB
  * vertical scaling is expensive
  * horizontal also
 * Performance could be better
