#summary all about NoSQL

 * based on talks by [http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Using-Spring-with-NoSQL-Databases Chris Richardson and Mark Pollack]

== NoSQL == 
 * No joins
 * very limited "transactions"
 * different durability and consistency guarantees
 * NoSQL datastores are used as "point solutions"
  * Amazon
  * Google
  * Facebook
  * LinkedIn
== NoSQL Examples ==

 * HBase
 * CouchDB

 * Gemfire
 * Sones
 * InfoGrid
 * Hadoop
 * MongoDB
 * RavenDB
 * Tokyo Cabinet

 * Coherence
 * Mnesia
 * Riak
 * Voldemort
 * Gigaspaces
 * Amazon SimpleDB
 * Redis
 * BerkeleyDB
 * MemcacheDB
 * Tamino
 * InfiniteGraph
 * Chordless
== Why NoSQL ==
 * Internet scale is main driver in using non-relational databases
  * Large data size - TBs to PBs
  * High Transaction rates
  * Need for high availability

== Problems with RDBMS ==
 * ORM impedance mismatch
  * complicated to map domain model to relational schema
  * relational schema is rigid (non-flexible, not easily changed)
 * RDBMS difficult to scale writes to DB
  * vertical scaling is expensive
  * horizontal also
 * Performance could be better
 * Transactions and joins reduce access rates
