== JMX Learning ==
 * JMX Architecture
  * MBeanServer acts as broker for communication between:
   * Multiple local MBean(s)
   * Remote clients and remote MBean(s)
   * Clients available (jconsole, jvisualvm, Hyperic)
 * MBean 
  * an object with management metadata
  * an MBean is an object with additional management metadata
   * Attributes (properties)
   * Operations (methods)
  * MBean management metadata can be defined statically with a Java interface or defined dynamically at runtime.
   * Simple MBean - statically defined MBean with a Java interface
   * Dynamic MBean - metadata defined dynamically at runtime
 * Goals of JMX - Java Management Extensions:
   * A standard, dynamic way of managing and monitoring resources such as applications, devices, and services.
   * Databases.
   * Message services.
   * WAR modules.
   * EJB modules.
   * Application components.
   * Application servers.
 * Things you can do with JMX:
  * Retrieve info about and application at runtime
  * Dynamically reconfiguration application (while it's running)
  * Trigger operations inside an application
