  * Both injections occur in the following order:

  * Dependency Injection.
 * The 3 techniques for wiring component together.
  * Constructor injection.
  * Setter injection.
  * Factory method injection.
 * The XML element for constructor injection.
  * constructor-arg
 * The XML element for setter injection.
