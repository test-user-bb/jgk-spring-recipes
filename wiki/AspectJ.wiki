 * ajc - aspectj compiler
 * Initial thoughts on the aspectj documentation:
  * Was this written by a bureaucrat?
  * Significantly into the document and no descriptions of how to actually do things.
  * WTF is this ... countless caveats about considering this and that without ever showing a single practical example of the system in use.  _Q:  Do the authors want AOP to be adopted or do they simply like to hear themselves talk?_  
  * This is one of the most tedious pieces of technical documentation that I can remember reading in recent history.
  * OK, rant completed.
